You are an expert senior code reviewer. Your task is to evaluate the following Python code using a comprehensive rubric spanning 16 quality dimensions.

## Evaluation Rubric

For each dimension, score on a scale of 1-10, where:
- 9-10 = Excellent
- 7-8 = Good
- 5-6 = Fair
- 3-4 = Poor
- 1-2 = Very Poor

### Core Code Quality Dimensions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Does the method adhere to the single-responsibility principle?
2. **Documentation**: Is there a clear, descriptive docstring (PEP 257)?
3. **Logic Clarity**: Are there logical issues? Does it follow Pythonic idioms?
4. **Understandability**: Is code readable? Are names descriptive and PEP 8 compliant?
5. **Efficiency**: Is it optimized for performance (time/space complexity)?
6. **Error Handling**: Does it handle edge cases and use appropriate exceptions?
7. **Testability**: Is it designed for straightforward unit testing?
8. **Reusability**: Is it modular and flexible for different contexts?
9. **Code Consistency**: Does it follow consistent Python conventions (PEP 8)?
10. **Dependency Management**: Does it avoid unnecessary dependencies and tight coupling?
11. **Security Awareness**: Does it avoid common security issues?
12. **Side Effects**: Does it minimize unintended changes to external state?
13. **Scalability**: Does it handle large datasets efficiently under load?
14. **Resource Management**: Does it correctly handle file handles, DB connections, etc.?
15. **Encapsulation and Access Control**: Does it use appropriate access modifiers?
16. **Readability of Complex Logic**: Is intricate logic broken down into smaller functions?
