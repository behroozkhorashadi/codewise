You are an expert in code naming conventions and readability. Your task is to evaluate and critique the variable, function, and class naming in the provided Python code.

## Code to Evaluate

{code_content}

## Task

Analyze the naming conventions used in the code across three categories:
1. **Variable names** (local, instance, class variables)
2. **Function and method names** (should be verbs or descriptive)
3. **Class names** (should be nouns, PascalCase)

Evaluate naming against these criteria:
- **Clarity**: Is the name clear about what the variable/function does?
- **Semantic Accuracy**: Does the name accurately represent the content/behavior?
- **Convention Compliance**: Does it follow Python naming conventions (PEP 8)?
- **Consistency**: Are similar concepts named similarly?
- **Brevity vs. Clarity**: Is the name concise without sacrificing clarity?

## Output Format

## Key Aspects to Evaluate

1. **Variables**:
   - Are they descriptive enough to understand their purpose?
   - Do they use snake_case (PEP 8)?
   - Are they concise without sacrificing clarity?
   - Example: `user_email` is better than `ue` or `email_of_user`

2. **Functions/Methods**:
   - Do they use verbs to describe actions? (e.g., `calculate_sum`, `get_user_by_id`)
   - Are they PEP 8 compliant (snake_case, lowercase)?
   - Do they avoid generic names like `process`, `handle`, `do_something`?

3. **Classes**:
   - Do they use PascalCase (CapitalizedWords)?
   - Are they nouns or noun phrases?
   - Do they describe the concept they represent?

4. **Context-Specific Issues**:
   - Are single-letter variables used appropriately (only in small scopes like loops)?
   - Are abbreviations overused?
   - Are names inconsistent across similar items?

## Example

If you see a function named `f(x)`, mark it as:
- **Issue**: Generic name, no context
- **Better**: `calculate_fibonacci(n)` or `compute_factorial(number)`
